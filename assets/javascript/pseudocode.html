///Pseudo code (combined JS on each HTML page below)

====================== Page 1 (User Input) ==================== 

// Define variables userFirstName and userLastName that contain the First and Last name of the user.  
		var userFirstName;
		var userLastName ;

// Define variable userLocation that contains the location of the user which is a five digit zip code
		var userLocation = "zip code"

// A submit button at the bottom of the page, should store the info into firebase   
// and take the user to a second html Page. This happens because of the form action in the html page 
	

// After the user clicks the submit button, a globe Giphy directs the user to the second page 

// Could possibily use typed JS (new tech) when user inputs info

====================== Page 2 (Volunteer Results) =========================

// Define volunteer orgs and destinations with the variable volunteerOrgDestination 
// defined as an array of 35 objects.
// each object has a city and an array of 3 volunteer orgs at that city

	var volunteerOrgDestination = [35 cities with possible 3 organisations to volunteer at]
	
	 
// As the second page loads the user will see three choices of volunteer orgs
// the 3 choices correspond to one randomly chosen city from the array of 35. 
// This result is the return value from the below function 

	// This function will load the volunteer org results 
		function getVolunteerResults(){
		// Using the url from the AJAX call to pull from the volunteer org API
			var queryURL;
		// Define variable searchVolunteerOrg that..
		// ..takes the value randomly from the array defined by volunteerOrg
			var searchVolunteerOrg; 

		// This is the Ajax call that gets the data from the volunteerOrg APIs
			$.ajax({
	          url: queryURL,
	          method: "GET"
	        }).done(function(response) {
	        	
	        });

		}
		
		//randomOrg is an array containing 3 randomly picked volunteer Organisation destinations
		//These 3 are provided as the possible options for the user to go to



	var randomOrg = function(volunteerOrgDestination, 3)
	{

		var result = [];
		for(var i=0; i<3; i++)
		{
			result.push(volunteerOrgDestination[Math.floor(Math.random()*(volunteerOrgDestination.length-1))+1]);

		}

		return result;

	}


// Each result will display
    // 1) A clickable image that will direct the user to the volunteer website 
    // 2) The name of the city
    // 3) A check box to select 

// On the bottom of the page, the user will have the option to refresh the results with the click of a button

// The user selection(s) will be saved in firebase 

// a globe Giphy directs the user to the third page when user checks the check-box against the volunteer org chosen


// ====================== EVENT LISTENERS (PLACEHOLDER) ===================== 
// getVolunteerResults()

// use jquery to select the submit button once its clicked 
 $(buttonID).on('click')

 $("p").on("click", function(){
    alert("The paragraph was clicked.");
});

====================== Page 3 (Flight Results) =======================

// On page load the user will be prompted to enter date of travel. 

// Once this field is filled in with the datepicker widget, 
// the user will...
// ...see all the flight possibilites..
// ..to the selected destination from Page 2

// The flight data will be pulled from the travel APIs below
	/ https://aviation-edge.com/developers/

// Each result will display:
   // 1) Date of travel
   // 2) Origin and destination
   // 3) Price
   // 4) Current weather of the destination pulled from the API below
   / http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city name}APPID=e5c3008e506fa23de24affb1ca78a0c8
   		APIKEY = e5c3008e506fa23de24affb1ca78a0c8
   // 5) Selection box to check out 


// Once the user selects a suitable flight and confirms the payment..
// ..the current html page will be reloaded with a thank you message!! :D

New Technology:

somewhere, we need to give the user an option to pick date of travel

that would be a text field

in this field, we use a jquery widget called datepicker, that autofills the date in the field,
 with a calendar tool

  within head tags...

<script>
  $( function() {
    $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
  } );
  </script>

and then in the body....
<p> Date: <input type = "text" id="datepicker" /></p>
